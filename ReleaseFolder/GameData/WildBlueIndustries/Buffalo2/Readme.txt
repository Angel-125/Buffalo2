Buffalo2 MSEV - Explore Space In Style

The NASA Multimission Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) Is a radical new concept that uses common components for ground rovers and in-space exploration craft. This modularity opens up the possibility of a variety of different configurations. The Buffalo2 Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV) is the KSP equivalent from Wild Blue Industries. With the Buffalo2, you can explore space in style!

Features
- Modular design lets you build rovers, stations, and submarines
- Fits inside the standard 3.75m cargo bay.
- Can be 3D printed and assembled in the field via Sandcastle.
